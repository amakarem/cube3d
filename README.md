# cub3D - 42 School Project

## Project Overview

The aim of cub3D is to create a dynamic view inside a maze, similar to the legendary Wolfenstein 3D game (which was the first FPS ever). This project serves as a playground to explore the techniques of ray-casting. The game features wall collisions, textured walls, and sprites.

## Features

- Dynamic camera movement
- Textured walls and objects
- Simple sprite-based enemies
- Wall collision detection
